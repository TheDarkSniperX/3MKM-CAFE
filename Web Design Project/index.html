      <h2>Our Story: More Than Just a Cup</h2>
      <h3>A Neighborhood Anchor</h3>
      <p>
        The Daily Grind didn’t start in a boardroom; it started in a small home
        kitchen over a shared French press. We noticed that while coffee was
        everywhere, connection was becoming harder to find. We set out to create
        a sanctuary—a place where the hiss of the steam wand and the smell of
        toasted sourdough act as a backdrop for first dates, business
        breakthroughs, and quiet moments of reflection.
      </p>
      <h3>Our Craft & Sourcing</h3>
      <p>
        We treat coffee as an art form and a science. Our beans are seasonally
        selected from single-origin farms, ensuring that the farmers are paid a
        premium for their dedication to quality. Every shot of espresso is
        dialed in daily, and our signature Lavender Honey Latte features honey
        sourced from apiaries less than twenty miles from our front door.
      </p>
      <h3>Sustainability in Every Sip</h3>
      <p>
        We are deeply committed to leaving a light footprint. From our
        compostable takeaway cups to our "Bring Your Own Mugg" discount, we
        believe that great coffee shouldn't come at the cost of the planet. Even
        our coffee grounds don't go to waste—we bag them up for local gardeners
        to use as nutrient-rich fertilizer for their soil.
      </p>
      <h3>Your Third Place</h3>
      <p>
        Sociologists often talk about the "Third Place"—that essential space
        between home and work. At The Daily Grind, we strive to be that space
        for you. Whether you are a "regular" whose order we know by heart or a
        first-time visitor seeking a quick caffeine fix, you are part of the
        fabric of our shop.
      </p>
      <p class="last-p">
        "We don't just serve coffee; we serve the people who make our community
        what it is."
